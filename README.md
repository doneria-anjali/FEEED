# Time Series Analysis of Food Donation Data for Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina

This project is developed for the credits of CSC 630 (Independent Study) under the supervision of Dr. Min Chi, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University.

The data provided by FBCENC for the FY 2006-2017 has been analysed to recognize the pattern of food donations by donors and purchase trends from vendors. 

The sql_scripts folder contains scripts that create MySQL views aggregating data from FY2006 - FY2017 into one view, creates categorized views for purchase_data, transfer_data, distribution_data, positive_adjustment_data and negative_adjustment_data.

The processing_scripts folder contains following scripts developed in Python 3.5:
1. clean_data.py cleans up the data for all fiscal years and extracts the meaningful attributes and stores them
2. donation_data.py processes data for generating graphs for food donations by donors
3. purchase_data.py processes data for generationg graphs for food purchases from vendors
